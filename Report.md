+ **Storytelling**: In this process, I first went to my User Dashboard and I made a new repository called DS_Health_MyFirstRepo. It gave me the option to 
add a README.md file so I clicked yes. After that, I opened the DS_Health_MyFirstRepo and I clicked the green Code button, I made sure HTTPS was 
selected, and copies the URL it gave me there. Then I opened Terminal (since I am on a Mac) and typed in "*cd Documents*" (because I wanted to save therepository
in Documents). After that, I cloned the repository but this is when it started giving me problems. Since I am usually an R Studio user, it automatically 
took me to R Studio. This was a problem because in this class I know we will mainly be using Python or Visual Studio Code. So I had to figure out how to make it 
so it opened in Visual Studio Code while I am still learning Python. I did this by making sure I was in my repository folder and ran "*code Report.md*" which
helped solve my issue by making it open in VS Code. After that, I had to figure out how to commit and push Report.md from there. I clicked Source 
Control and typed "*Add Report.md file*" in the little Message tab and clicked the "*Commit*" button. After that it asked me if I wanted to sync the changes
and I clicked "*Yes*" which made it visible on GitHub. I created an issue by clicking "*Issues*" under my repository name and selecting "*New Issu*e". Finally,
I added the profile picture by going into Finder and just adding it under the DS_Health_MyFirstRepo folder. 

+ **Reflection**: This whole process was honestly different and difficult for me. I don't usually work on GitHub so a lot of things were very confusing for me
and I had to ask ChatGPT for a lot of help and support while trying to teach myself. I had some issues with the folders as, for some reason, 
when I first went to open the file in Visual Studio Code, it made a separate file with all of what I needed inside of there so I had to go through
a lot of sorting in the Terminal and Finder app. However, I did learn from this experience regardless of how frustrating it was beginning to get.
I would say I am still confused about how the whole process works as I am fairly new to this but I will make sure that I put in the work to familiarize myself 
with it more and more.

Storytelling (20 Points): Provide a self-contained "story" of what you did with your new repository (the process of cloning, adding the README, 
committing, pushing, and creating an issue).
Reflect (20 Points): Answer what you learned and what you are still confused about.
Stylize (10 Points): Experiment with different markdown styles (bold, italics, colors, headers, tables, bullet points, etc.) to make your 
report professional and engaging.
Visuals (10 Points): Please include at least two images in your report:
A screenshot of your new repository's main page or the issue you created.
The image file you added to the repository in step 1, displayed using markdown syntax.
